# What is it?
EasyImage allow you to easily take picture from gallery, camera or documents without creating lots of boilerplate.
  
# How to use it?
## Essentials

#### Taking straight to camera
- ```EasyImage.openCamera(Activity activity, int type);```
- ```EasyImage.openCamera(Fragment fragment, int type);```

#### Taking straight to gallery or the gallery picker if there is more than 1 gallery app
- ```EasyImage.openGallery(Activity activity, int typee);```
- ```EasyImage.openGallery(Fragment fragment, int type);```

#### Taking straight to documents app
- ```EasyImage.openDocuments(Activity activity, int type);```
- ```EasyImage.openDocuments(Fragment fragment, int type);```

#### Displaying system picker to chose from camera or documents or gallery if no documents app available
- ```EasyImage.openChooserWithDocuments(Activity activity, String chooserTitle, int type);```
- ```EasyImage.openChooserWithDocuments(Fragment fragment, String chooserTitle, int type);```

#### Displaying system picker to chose from camera or gallery app
- ```EasyImage.openChooserWithGallery(Activity activity, String chooserTitle, int type);```
- ```EasyImage.openChooserWithGallery(Fragment fragment, String chooserTitle, int type);```


Type param is there only if you wan't to return different kind of images on the same screen, otherwise it's not relevant. If so just pass any int there.

#### Getting the photo file

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    EasyImage.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data, this, new DefaultCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onImagePickerError(Exception e, EasyImage.ImageSource source, int type) {
            //Some error handling
        }

        @Override
        public void onImagesPicked(List<File> imagesFiles, EasyImage.ImageSource source, int type) {
            //Handle the images
            onPhotosReturned(imagesFiles);
        }
    });
}
```
## Additional features
#### Removing canceled but captured photo
If the user takes photo using camera, but then cancels, you might wanna remove that photo from the device.
Sample app present's the usage:
```java
  @Override
  public void onCanceled(EasyImage.ImageSource source, int type) {
      //Cancel handling, you might wanna remove taken photo if it was canceled
      if (source == EasyImage.ImageSource.CAMERA) {
          File photoFile = EasyImage.lastlyTakenButCanceledPhoto(MainActivity.this);
          if (photoFile != null) photoFile.delete();
      }
  }
  ```
#### Additional configuration
```java
  EasyImage.configuration(this)
          .setImagesFolderName("My app images") //images folder name, default is "EasyImage"
          //.saveInAppExternalFilesDir() //if you want to use root internal memory for storying images
          .saveInRootPicturesDirectory(); //if you want to use internal memory for storying images - default
	  .setAllowMultiplePickInGallery(true) //allows multiple picking in galleries that handle it. Also only for phones with API 18+ but it won't crash lower APIs. False by default
```
Configuration is persisted so if you want to clear it before the next use call 
```java
EasyImage.clearConfiguration(Context context);
```

# Setup

## Runtime permissions
Library requires permission from your app. Declare it in your ```AndroidMnifest.xml```
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

**Please note** that for devices running API 23 (marshmallow) you have to request this permission in the runtime, before calling ```EasyImage.openCamera()```. It's demonstrated in the sample app.

**There is also one issue about runtime permissions**. According to the docs: 

```If your app targets M and above and declares as using the CAMERA permission which is not granted, then attempting to use this action will result in a SecurityException.``` 

For this reason, if your app uses ```CAMERA``` permission, you should check it **aswell** as ```WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE``` before calling 
```java 
EasyImage.openCamera()
```

[This library](https://github.com/tajchert/Nammu) will help you manage runtime permissions.
