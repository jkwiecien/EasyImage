##Additional features
####Removing canceled but captured photo
If the user takes photo using camera, but then cancels, you might wanna remove that photo from the device.
Sample app present's the usage:
```java
            @Override
            public void onCanceled(EasyImage.ImageSource source) {
                //Cancel handling, you might wanna remove taken photo if it was canceled
                if (source == EasyImage.ImageSource.CAMERA) {
                    File photoFile = EasyImage.lastlyTakenButCanceledPhoto(MainActivity.this);
                    if (photoFile != null) photoFile.delete();
                }
            }
  ```
####Additional configuration
```java
        EasyImage.configuration(this)
                .setImagesFolderName("My app images") //images folder name, default is "EasyImage"
                //.saveInAppExternalFilesDir() //if you want to use root internal memory for storying images
                .saveInRootPicturesDirectory(); //if you want to use internal memory for storying images - default
```
Configuration is persisted so if you wan't to clear it before the next use call 
```java
EasyImage.clearConfiguration(Context context);
```

#Setup

##Runtime permissions
Library requires permission from your app. Declare it in your ```AndroidMnifest.xml```
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

**Please note** that for devices running API 23 (marshmallow) you have to request this permission in the runtime, beofre calling ```EasyImage.openCamera()```. It's demonstrated in the sample app.

**There is also one issue about runtime permissions**. According to the docs: 

``` if you app targets M and above and declares as using the CAMERA permission which is not granted, then atempting to use this action will result in a SecurityException.``` 

For this reason, if your app uses ```CAMERA``` permission, you should check it **aswell** as ```WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE``` before calling 
```java 
EasyImage.openCamera()
```

[This library](https://github.com/tajchert/Nammu) will help you manage runtime permissions.

repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
